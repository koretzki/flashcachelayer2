{"tagline":"Flash Cache Layer for Hybrid Storage Systems integrating SSDs and HDDs","google":"","body":"# Flash Cache Layer (FCL)\r\nThe FCL is a core software for hybrid storage systems that integrate high-performance SSDs into large-capacity HDDs, or MLC based SSDs. The main role of the FCL is to manage SSDs as a data cache with various cache algorithms. It is implemented in CMU DiskSim with MSR SSD Extension. \r\n\r\n### Various FCLs\r\n  * FP-FCL (Fixed Partitioning): SSD is used as a data cache device with LRU algorithm.\r\n  * RW-FCL (Read Write Partitioning): Read and Write data would be distinguished due to GC of SSD. (Now implementing) \r\n  * OP-FCL (Optimal Partitioning): Our proposed scheme in USENIX FAST 2012. (Now implementing) \r\n\r\n\r\n# Supported Feature \r\n  * LRU-based Data Caching \r\n  * Background Data Migration \r\n  * Prefetching (not yet implemented)\r\n  * Trim Command  (not yet implemented) \r\n\r\n\r\n# Installation \r\n  * download \r\n  * tar xvfj fcl-beta-release-0.1.tar.gz\r\n  * cd fcl-beta-release-0.1\r\n  * make \r\n  * cd hybrid_valid/maxtor-sample1\r\n  * download <http://www.mpi-sws.org/~vahldiek/diskmodels/maxtor146g.tar.gz>\r\n  * tar xvfj maxtor146g.tar.gz\r\n  * mv maxtor146g/{{{*}}} hybrid_valid/maxtor-sample1 \r\n  * set the parameter *Max Queue Length = 1* in maxtor146g.diskspecs file\r\n  * ./script_fixed\r\n  * ./script_rw\r\n  * ./script_optimal\r\n  * ./response\r\n\r\n# Simulation Result\r\n![Result](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/oimg?key=0AoWducd2Df_KdFBpd1pQc19NWFNBQ0hmNmlicjdGd3c&oid=1&zx=h33s22hzid1&nonsense=result.png)\r\n\r\n# People \r\n  * Yongseok Oh <http://ysoh.wordpress.com>\r\n  * Jongmoo Choi <http://embedded.dankook.ac.kr/~choijm>\r\n  * Donghee Lee <http://embedded.uos.ac.kr>\r\n  * Sam H.
